# excel95-cracker

A shitty C++ implementation of the Excel95 algorithm that is only for demonstration purposes. This example mixes the usage of C-strings and String strings, and is an anti-example of how to write good code.

## Usage:

```
-e Encrypt using the legacy Excel95 XOR bitshift algorithm
-c Crack/Find a collision
-h Display help

```

## Example Usage

```

./excelfun -c cbab

```
